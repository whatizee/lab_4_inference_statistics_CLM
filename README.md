# lab_4_inference_statistics_CLM
The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) asserts that, with a sufficiently large sample size, the distribution of the sample mean will be approximately normal, regardless of the underlying population distribution. This is pivotal for statistical inferences, allowing normal distribution assumptions for estimating population parameters from sample data.
